  <h1 #aboutMe>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is <strong>Grey Ruessler</strong>, and I'm a
    <strong>senior software engineer</strong>. I've been coding for
    <strong> {{ codingYears$ | async }} years</strong> now; I fell in love with
    game programming as a kid, and I've been captivated with technology ever
    since. In college, I majored in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, which gave
    me valuable experience with
    <strong>low-level programming, virtualization, networking,</strong> and much
    more. Today, I do <strong>full-stack engineering</strong>, with an emphasis
    on <strong>designing resilient and performant systems</strong>. That said,
    I'm always looking for new ways to apply my love for the field, and would
    love to stay diversified!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm Texas born and raised, currently <strong>working remotely</strong> out
    of the midwest but <strong>open to relocation.</strong> My only criteria is
    that I'd like to be somewhere temperate to chilly; I don't miss the Dallas
    summers! I am happy to work on a variety of schedules, but lean towards
    mornings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of my career as a software engineer, I've been pursuing
    <strong>photography</strong> for the past
    <strong>{{ photographyYears$ | async }} years</strong>. I've always loved
    nature, and in my line of work, it's more important than ever to get offline
    and disconnect. I shoot a variety of styles, from headshots to landscapes,
    and I'm keen on learning about interesting opportunities.
